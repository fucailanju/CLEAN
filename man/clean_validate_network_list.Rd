\title{Validate adjacency matrices for CLEAN (multiple time slices)}
\usage{
clean_validate_network_list(A_by_time, ids_by_time = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{A_by_time}{Named list of adjacency matrices. Each element must be a square matrix
(or coercible to matrix). Names should match the time values used in the panel (e.g., "1951").}

\item{ids_by_time}{Optional named list of character vectors. If provided, it must contain
the same names as `A_by_time`. Each `ids_by_time[[nm]]` gives the node IDs for that slice
(panel ordering) and is passed as `ids=` into [clean_validate_network()].}

\item{...}{Additional arguments forwarded to [clean_validate_network()], e.g.
`directed`, `value_type`, `sym_action`, `sym_rule`, `zero_diag`, `allow_isolates`.}
}
\value{
A named list of validated adjacency matrices, with the same names as `A_by_time`.
}
\description{
Validates a *named list* of adjacency matrices (e.g., yearly/monthly slices).
For each slice name `nm`, this calls [clean_validate_network()] on `A_by_time[[nm]]`,
optionally aligning node labels/order using `ids_by_time[[nm]]`.
}
\examples{
# Suppose A_by_time is a named list of yearly adjacency matrices:
# A_by_time <- list("2001" = A2001, "2002" = A2002)
# ids_by_time <- list("2001" = ids2001, "2002" = ids2002)
# A_ok <- clean_validate_network_list(A_by_time, ids_by_time,
#   directed = TRUE, value_type = "binary", zero_diag = TRUE)
